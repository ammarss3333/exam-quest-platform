      "passage": "The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a major turning point in history. It transformed economies that had been based on agriculture and handicrafts into economies based on large-scale industry, mechanized manufacturing, and the factory system. New machines, new power sources, and new ways of organizing work made existing industries more productive and efficient. The textile industry was one of the first to adopt these changes, with inventions like the spinning jenny and power loom revolutionizing cloth production.",

      "passage": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct. The process occurs in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes, chlorophyll absorbs light energy that is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen and producing ATP and NADPH.",
